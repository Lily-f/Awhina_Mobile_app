# Awhina_Mobile_app
This project is what I worked on during my fourth year of study at Victoria university for one of my courses. The goal of this project was to meet with some Ä€whina group staff members and implement a mobile app to meet their needs of connecting with students. To meet this requirement I designed a server and a mobile app that would allow students and staff to set up mentoring sessions and workshops, record student attendance, and allow users to message one another. This repo contains some of the design documents and reports that I wrote through the project as well as the code. It took place over the course of a year but was not completed as I graduated half way through the second trimester.
